  @javascript
  Scenario: Watchers shouldn't be copied when the user doesn't have the permission to
    Given I am already logged in as "ndnd"
    When I go to the copy page for the work package "Improve drive"
    Then I should not see "Watchers"
    When I fill in "Subject" with "Improve drive even more"
    And I submit the form by the "Create" button
    Then I should see "Improve drive even more"
    # FIXME: we need to address this in a different way
    # Then I should not see "Watchers"
    And the issue "Improve drive even more" should have 0 watchers

  @javascript
  Scenario: Watchers should be copied when the user has the permission to
    Given I am already logged in as "lrrr"
    When I go to the copy page for the work package "Improve drive"
    Then I should see "Watchers" within "#timelog"
    When I fill in "Subject" with "Improve drive even more"
    And I submit the form by the "Create" button
    Then I should see "Improve drive even more"
    # FIXME: we do not have the badge yet but we should add it
    # Then I should see "Watchers (2)"
    And the issue "Improve drive even more" should have 2 watchers
