  Background:
    Given there is 1 user with:
      | login     | manager |
      | firstname | the     |

    And there is 1 project with the following:

      | view_time_entries  |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the user "manager" is a "manager"
    And there are the following status:
      | name    | default |
      | status1 | true    |
    And there are the following work packages in project "ecookbook":
      | subject | status_id |
      | pe1     | 1         |
    And there is an activity "design"
    And I am already logged in as "manager"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Logging time
    When I go to the edit page of the work package called "pe1"
    And I fill in the following:
       | Spent time | 5         |
       | Activity   | design    |
       | Comment    | Needed it |
    And I submit the form by the "Submit" button
    Then the work package should be shown with the following values:
       | Spent time | 5.00      |
